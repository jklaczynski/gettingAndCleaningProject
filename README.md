README file for week 4 assingment in Getting and Cleaning Data <br> <br>

## This script assumes we're running in the directory that has the already unzipped files <br>
## from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip <br>
## Within this directory, two sub-directories exist - train and test  <br>
## These directories contain identical filenames (but not data) - these are all merged into one <br>
## easy to use, well labeled table. <br>
##  <br>
##  <br>
To run the analysis and create the summary and tidy tables, <br>
(1) Get and unpack (unzip) the data from the URL above <br>
(2) Source the "R" script from within R:  source run_analysis.R <br>
(3) Execute the script by typing: runAnalysis() <br> <br>


When the script is executed two tables will be created: <br>
  summaryTable - this contains the merged data <br>
  tidyTable - contains the tidy dataset requested in step 5 of the assignment <br> <br>

finally, the tidyTable is written as a csv file "tidyTable.csv" <br> <br>

The field descriptions in this file may be found in Codebook.md <br>
